    <h1>Hi! My name is MoJiSang</h1>
   <p>My name is Mo Ji Sang, and welcome to my life! I am a 25 year old male, and the eldest of my 4 siblings. I am currently studying to be a designer, as well as to be a fashion model. I hope that one day, i will be able to walk the runways of Paris Fashion Week, and design for it as well!

    In my free time, i like to take long walks along various nature parks. Nature is a truly great source of inspiration, and i often find many ideas during these walks. My wife often tags along, and we discuss the different types of flora and fauna found along the trails. 
    
    Should you see me in public, feel free to say hi or ask more about me!</p>

   <h2>My strengthes as a designer are...</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I am able to work well under pressure. Whether there's an approaching deadline or shareholders breathing down my neck, i perform efficiently, always.</li>
      <li>i am very creative when it comes to designing new products. Taking inspiration from many natural forms, my designs are always new and refreshing.</li>
      <li>i am a risk-taker. As the saying goes: "you have to risk it to get the biscuit".</li>
      <li>i work well in a group. Being able to keep cool headed during heated discussions allow me to keep perspective and work to resolve issues effectively.</li>
    </ul>
